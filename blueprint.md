# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a web application called "Career Matchmaker" that provides smart career recommendations. It uses a factor-based job matching algorithm to help users find their next career move.

## Design & Features (v1.0)

*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for a utility-first styling approach, enabling rapid and custom UI development.
*   **Font:** Default sans-serif font provided by Tailwind CSS.
*   **Layout:** A clean, responsive, and modern layout built with flexbox and grid utilities from Tailwind.
*   **Core Component:** A central form component (`QeaForm.tsx`) for user input, styled entirely with Tailwind CSS.
*   **Color Palette:** A modern color scheme centered around Indigo for primary actions and Gray for text and backgrounds.

## Current Plan

*   **Objective:** Revert from Ant Design back to a pure Tailwind CSS implementation.
*   **Status:** Completed. The application now exclusively uses Tailwind CSS for all styling, providing a consistent and lightweight design system.
